# Agency Introduction

### Mission

The Brand Working Group exists to promote awareness and engagement of both the Edgeware technical platform, as well as the Edgeware Community.  It exists primarily to represent the interests of the Edgeware Community, who benefit from the health and success of the platform.

### Vision

**Make Edgeware a Meme**

Like Synthetix, Chainlink, and XRP, these platforms have communities that take on a life of their own, with viral content that demonstrates a unique aesthetic style, self-awareness, awareness of competitors and ecosystem pain points. The ease of replication, repetition and scaling of these campaigns is core to the success of meme marketing for protocols. 

### Strategy

**Growing the Community**

- Take advantage of prevailing narratives to insert Edgeware into the conversation at every turn. 'Edgeware Solves This' — repetition makes things true.
- Improve the Community Organizing and Onboarding Process so there is one place to go, and channels expand after they are onboarded. The setup is too complicated and disorganized at this time.
- Developing a visual brand that is easily recognizable and striking within channels, in order to support awareness.

**Growing the Working Group**

- Planning community-centered events and content to highlight the opportunities and work of the BWG.
- Maintaining a system of recognition for participants, perhaps using Combot. Championing those that succeed and empowering them with further resources.
- Designing an on-ramp in the community onboarding process to the BWG.
- Developing the BWG's unique voice and priorities within the Edgeware ecosystem.

**Conducting** **Experiments**

- Planning messaging in accordance with vision and use cases for a variety of formats and channels, monitoring their performance in order to discover protocol-channel fit.
- Taking feedback on narrative, use case and vision to refine that messaging and codify a set of guidances for internal use so new BWG members can easily learn and onboard to promote repitation and unity on messaging.
